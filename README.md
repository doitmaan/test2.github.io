# Interactive Web Terminal ðŸ–¥

I coded this website as a fun way to present my portfolio. Some cool features that I implemented are:
- personal GitHub repos are found automatically and displayed when you type `projects`;
- the terminal has tab-completion and displays auto-complete-suggestions similar to the beatiful shell [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh);
- you can switch between terminal themes with a single command: `theme set ...`
